## hi there!

### About me
Hello, I'm [Yunus Sogut](https://github.com/Yunus1903), a passionate IT student from Belgium with a variety of skills in software & hardware.
My knowledge is mostly self-taught and partly from my studies. I'm mainly a back-end developer but occasionally do full-stack as well.

Open-source is something I totally stand for as I love to collaborate and learn lots from open-source communities.

With my background in electronics I occasionally work on IoT projects and automation at home.
